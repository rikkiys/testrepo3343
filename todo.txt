Create a static mockup version of the application in HTML format with hardcoded data.
It must consist minimum of 4 pages:

- List of items for each entity (e.g., list of departments and list of employees in the departments;
- Item details page for each entity.

In addition:
- at least one page must have a field for searching items by date. 
For example, searching for employees born on a certain date or in the period between dates. 
This step doesn't require the implementation of the search process. 
All you need is to display the field.

Apart from that:
- there must be buttons/forms/pages that allow you to change (add/edit/delete) the data. 
As in the previous point, there is no need to implement data change, it's just a mockup :)

All pages have to include hyperlinks to simulate application use cases. 

Inside "documentation" folder create folder "html_prototype" and push static prototype there.
